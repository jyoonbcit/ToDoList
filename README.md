# ToDoList
Originally developed for Hack the Break 2023 hackathon. <br>
Our main difficulty in this project was trying to learn several aspects of React in a brief time period. <br>
While we did not submit our project for judging, we did manage to get a basic implementation of a to-do list working as well as a better grasp of how to use React.

## Future Updates
- Implementing a Java backend storage
